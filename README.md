# Golden Diff

[![Publish Extension](https://github.com/jeilsonaraujo/golden_diff/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jeilsonaraujo/golden_diff/actions/workflows/publish.yml)

Easily compare golden failures and check the difference. A valuable tool to save you time in Flutter development and automated tests.

## Features

This extension looks for images of golden test failures on your project, it makes a list with all the files reached.
By clicking on one it's possible to see the difference between the expected image and the image that was generated by the golden toolkit.

Once there are test failures on your project, there will be a slider that reveals the expected image above the failure.

## Let's see an example:

Imagine you've made some alterations, and suddenly, the tests begin to fail:
