## Features

This extension looks for images of golden test failures on your project, it makes a list with all the files reached.
By clicking on one it's possible to see the difference between the expected image and the image that was generated by the golden toolkit.

Once there are test failures on your project, there will be a slider that reveals the expected image above the failure.

Suppose we developed this screen:

After we make some changes on the theme and we run the tests it will fail.




Here it's where the failures can be found:

This shows how easy is to compare the images:
